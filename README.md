# fns - Factorial Number System

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial_number_system), "the factorial number system,
also called factoradic, is a mixed radix numeral system adapted to numbering permutations". This repository aims
at offering a series of algorithms to perform basic arithmetic operations between two numbers in this number system,
in the form of a simple interactive calculator (see [code](https://github.com/lluisalemanypuig/fns/blob/master/src/calculator.cpp)).

It also offers a simple code to process all permutations of a list of N elements in parellel (here using OpenMP)
(see [code](https://github.com/lluisalemanypuig/fns/blob/master/src/permutations.cpp))
