According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial_number_system), "the factorial number system,
also called factoradic, is a mixed radix numeral system adapted to numbering permutations". This repository aims
at offering a series of algorithms to perform basic arithmetic operations between two numbers in this number system,
in the form of a simple interactive calculator.

It also offers a simple code to process all permutations of a list of N elements in parellel (here using OpenMP).
